## Content of files within this folder

- **nlp_1.pdf**: This file shows my answers for part 1 of the project which essentially asked me to categorise what types of NLP applications may be at use in various scenarios. For example how an email service might recognise and allocate emails to a certain folder such as 'work', 'friends', etc.
- **nlp_2.pdf**: This file shows my answer for part 2 of the project which was to research and summarise a real life example of a technolgy used by a company that employs NLP applications. My answer relates to a technology called Google Duplex.
